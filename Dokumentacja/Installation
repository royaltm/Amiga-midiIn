How to install midiIn:

  It is very simple, you probably have already done it.

  You have to unpack the archive file (what you probably did).
  midiIn.lha archive should LINK (and must) contain:

    midiIn       length - the main program
    midiIn.info  length - its icon
    midiIn.guide length - this documentation
    midiIn.prefs length - a default prefs file
    projects/    <dir>  - an empty directory to store Your projects in
    midiIn.sig   length - md5sum of all files signed with my secret LINK PGP keyring
     to get my public keyring LINK mail me, or you can finger the same address as well.
    libs/reqtools.library
    libs/midi.library

  If you don't have those two libraries installed yet, copy them to your
  LIBS: directory.

  What you should know:

  No assigns nor environment variables are needed for midiIn.
  The configuration file is saved in the same directory, the main
  program is in ('PROGDIR:midiIn.pref').
  Configuration file contains: sound LINK preferences, default LINK paths
  to projects and samples and default LINK sample list.
  The program doesn't need this file to operate.
  It requires both: reqtools.library and midi.library to be in LIBS:
  directory.
