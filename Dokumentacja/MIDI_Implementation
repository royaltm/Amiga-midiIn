                        MIDI implementation
                        ###################

   midiIn uses wonderful midi.library (C) Bill Barton, Pregnant
Badger Music, 1987, 1988. This is a very good software which enables
many programs to receive MIDI data at one time and to send MIDI data
through virtual wires and ports inside Amiga. It is a pity, that so
few MIDI programs for Amiga use this excellent solution.
   By the way: if You know about a good sequencer working with
midi.library, please let us know.

   Thanks to midi.library midiIn may receive MIDI messages from many
sources - MIDI interface and/or another programs using midi.library.
The list of available MIDI sources can be found in the Advanced
Window. You can select/deselect sources by clicking on them. "+"
before source means that midiIn receives messages from it. After
pressing the Refresh gadget midiIn will scan midi.library's
resources to make a new list of available sources. You have to
refresh the list every time You run a new program supposed to send
MIDI messages to midiIn.
   If there are no programs using midi.library for output running,
the only possibility is MidiIn - what means external MIDI interface
connected to the serial port.


MIDI messages understood by midiIn:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - NoteOn with Velocity parameter - starts the sound with volume
   depending on sample Velocity parameter, sample volume and
   velocity sensitivity set in <Sample details window>.
   
 - NoteOff - stops the sound; note that if You set duration to
   ON->ON in the <Main window>, You start and stop the sound with
   the NoteOn message; if a bank is set to DRUM mode Note Off
   doesn't stop the sound

 - Aftertouch - changes the volume of played sample depending on the
   Aftertouch value and the Aftertouch sensitivity set in <Sample
   details window>. It lets You control the volume dynamically, by
   changing the power of key pressure. Of course You must have a
   dynamic keyboard.

 - Pitch Bend - detunes the sample depending on movement of Pitch
   Bender joystick and Pitch Bender note range parameter from
   <Sample details window>.

 - Volume - sets the overall volume on specific MIDI channel; only banks
   with midi Volume gadget checked are affected by it

 - Panorama - sets the overall pan on specific MIDI channel; only banks
   with midi Pan gadget checked are affected by it

 - ResetAllControllers - sets Volume on all channels to maximum and
   Panorama in the center

 - AllSoundsOff - immidately cuts all sounds played by midiIn

 - AllNotesOff - stops all sounds; unlike AllSoundsOff it fades samples
   according to their envelope

   In future versions of midiIn we will try to implement the
Modulation message to control special effects on sample (AM, FM, chorus,
delay...) and control them with MidiClock.
