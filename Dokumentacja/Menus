                                  Menus
                                  #####

   This is a description of midiIn Main window's menu. Sample
detail window and Envelope window have the same menu except the
Settings entry. Scope window and Advanced settings window have no
menu at all.


   Project
   ^^^^^^^
    -> New LINK <Prepares a new projects>
    -> Open - LINK <loads a project from disk>
    -> AddProject - inserts an existing project starting from the active
                    bank; useful for adding made-before drums sets etc.
    -> ReladAll - reloads all samples used in banks. You should reaload
                  samples if You edited them in external sample editor
                  not quitting midiIn.
    -> Save - saves the project with the current name
              there is the project name displayed on the midiIn window's
              drag bar; if it is followed by an asterisk (*) it means that
              the project is changed and You have to save it to store the
              changes
    -> Save as - saves the project opening a file-requester allowing You
                 to change the path and the name of the project
    -> Info - displays information about number of loaded samples, memory
              allocated by them, free memory available and how long You are
              working with midiIn
    -> Hide - closes all midiIn windows except the Scope and Monitor
              windows without stopping to play; to restore the windows
              You have to press the combination of keys defined in
              midiIn's icon in CX_POPUP field. Default combination
              is "control shift m". midiIn is a system commodity, so
              You can also use the Exchange program and its "Show
              interface" function.
    -> About - opens the intro window with picture and introtext
    -> Quit - quits midiIn; if the project is unsaved midiIn asks You for
              confirmation

   Edit
   ^^^^ 
    -> Copy - copies the current bank to buffer
    -> Paste - pastes buffer to current bank
    -> Delete - clears all data in current bank
         see LINK <How to work with midiIn> for details

   Settings
   ^^^^^^^^
    -> Audio enable - allocates and frees audio.device
    -> Midi control - allows/permits MIDI control of midiIn
         see LINK <How to work with midiIn> for details
    -> Follow mode - turns on/off Follow mode, which changes the current
                     bank to the one played recently
    -> Advanced - opens a LINK <special window> in which You can change
                  the midi.library and sound player parameters
    -> Save default - saves <advanced settings>, <default paths to projects
                      and samples>, default <Instrument List>, and
                      depending on the Save layout flag, size and
                      position of all midiIn windows in
                      'PROGDIR:midiIn.pref' file, which is loaded
                      after starting midiIn.

      -> Save layout - this flag tells midiIn if size and position
                       of windows should be saved together with
                       settings. It should be turned off to avoid
                       saving random moves of windows with every
                       project. You should turn it on to set the
                       preferred layout and save it with Save
                       default function.

      -> Load with project - if turned on, midiIn will load settings
                       saved with every project on disk.

      -> Save icons - if checked, saves icon with every project; the icon
                      is def_midiIn_project which should be in the project,
                      sys:env, or PROGDIR:icons directory; if there's no
                      such icon it uses the default project icon.

    *NOTE: There's no def_midiIn_project icon so far. You can design one.
  It has to be both MagicWB and NewIcons compatible and a pretty one, of
  course. We're waiting!!!
