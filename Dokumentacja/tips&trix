   Here are some ideas about using midiIn without frustration that
it doesn't work correctly or it is acting strange. Most of it should
be written in other chapters, but this is a kind of summary. I also
remind You here about a few handy features.

   - it is important which of midiIn windows is active if You use
     keyboard shortcuts; moreover, be carefull because some
     shortcuts mean different things for different windows (for
     example 'm' turns on/off MIDI control in Main window and sets
     maximum possible volume in bank window); more about windows
     managment can be found in the <Windows chapter>

   - if the 'Load with project' flag in Settings menu is set You can
     unconciously change fundamental parameters of midiIn, just by
     loading an old project with strange settings, like for example
     turned off NoteOn message; You can always open the Advanced
     window and Undo the settings; anyway it is safer to have this
     flag unset and use it only if really necessary

   - if the midi Volume gadget in Bank window is set it may happen,
     that a sequencer sends Volume Controller = 0; the sample is
     then played with 0 volume (no sound), even if midiIn volume
     is normal; the value of Volume Controller for every channel is
     shown in the Monitor window

   - when You load a new sample to the bank, first select it's base
     note, then the range, because if You make it opposite You move
     the range by interval between the new and old (default) base
     note; by the way, I remind You that this is very convinient
     methode of moving the range together with the base note

   - use the Offset slider! sometimes cutting off first few
     miliseconds of sound (base drum, for example) makes it have a
     better attack; You can also achieve different effects, like
     starting a drum loop from the snare

   - if You don't like the default bank settings (Velocity,
     Aftertouch, midi Volume and midi Pan set to 0), make Your own
     'empty' project using copy & paste and load it before You build
     a new one

   - if You want a specific looped sample to play in background and play
     other short samples, set the looped sample's priority to higher, than
     other samples' priority; it is impossible then that one of short
     samples mutes the loop when running out of audio channels
