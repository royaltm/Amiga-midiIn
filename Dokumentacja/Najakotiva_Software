  We have an additional beta tester - Daniel Gagnon from Canada. Thanx for
Your support, Daniel!


   Najakotiva Software is a part of a big project - Najakotiva.

   Najakotiva is the multimedia art group from Warsaw, Poland, engaged
in various forms of artistic creation. Having started in 1994 as an
experimental music project, Najakotiva developed its activity to
photography, computer graphics, video and performance.
   However, the most important branch of our activity is music.
It may be described as electro industrial with live instruments. The players are:   
   
   Renata Gontarz - violin
   Kostek Usenko - cello
   Filip Rakowski - drums
   David Price - percussions
   Sebastian Witkowski - Amiga, Atari, Korg 01W, Roland SH-101, mixer
      and other stuff
   Martin Schmitz - Macintosh, Atari, Roland D-5, Korg DDD, things like that
   Pawel Kaczmar - didjeridou

   We use the old-style but still alive Atari ST as a sequencer,
Amiga 1200 with midiIn and Macintosh with some Mac soft as sample
players.
   BTW: if someone can help us in getting a HARD DISK controller for
Atari 1040 ST we would be grateful!

  Look out for the first Najakotiva album which should be available in
December 1998 in Poland, probably released by S.P.Records!!!
