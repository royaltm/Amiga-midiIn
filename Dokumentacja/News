 - AHI support
   Now You can use midiIn with Your brand-new Prelude, Melody,
Delfina, or old-and-still-good Toccata soundcard! 

 - Undo buffor
   midiIn remembers all Your actions. Everything You do or say...
sorry... Every change of parameters (incl. add Instrument, Edit
range, etc) can be undone and redone! You know what You're going to
undo - it's written in a box under the keyboard.
   That's not enough. The Undo buffer is saved with every project.
So You can undo things You've made three weeks ago (it's called a
time machine, isn't it? ;)

 - Portamento
   or glissando - in Mono mode. The sound will slide from last
played note to the current pitch. Try to experiment with drum loops -
You can imitate vinyl switched off.
   Portamento can be Velocity-sensitive. The faster You press the
key, the faster (shorter) the slide will be.

 - New look
   Now You can add your favourite pattern around the keyboard. The
bank buttons look different, too.

 - Multi select (copy paste exchange)
 - Progress Bar
 - Sorting banks
