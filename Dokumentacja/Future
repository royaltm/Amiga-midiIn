                          Future versions
                          ###############

   We are still developing midiIn. When You read this, there are
probably few new beta versions in testing. We are waiting for
feedback from the users. Please send us suggestions, bug reports and
ideas. We want to make midiIn a professional audio application for
Amiga - an application, which helps Amiga to be considered as a
serious tool in sound studio system.
   
What we want to do:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - midiIn www homepage
 - for soundcards users: 4 channels audio output!!! (2 AHI channels
   thru soundcard, plus two Amiga hardware 14-bit channels)
 - system of external DSP plug-ins (chorus, delay, filters) with
   Developer Kit, so ANYONE can write plug-ins for midiIn!
 - Amplitude and Frequency Modulation (or tremolo and vibrato)
   controlled by Modulation Controller and LFO's syncronised to MIDI
   Clock
 - new audio level display (LED-like)
 - tap tempo for easy synchronisation of drum loop samples with
   playing musicians
 - harddisk samples maybe...
 - more controllers in Monitor window
 - reverse sample and reverse loop
 - scratching (almost ready!)
 - Preview Mode for quick scan thru the Instrument List (clilck&hear)
 - much better (intelligent) AddProject function
 - faster response to MIDI messages
 - new Mixer window with faders and panorama pots for each bank
 - whatever You want ;)
