                          ###############

   We are still developing midiIn. When You read this, there are
probably few new beta versions in testing. We are waiting for
feedback from the users. Please send us suggestions, bug reports and
ideas. We want to make midiIn a professional audio application for
Amiga - an application, which helps Amiga to be considered as a
serious tool in sound studio system.
   This version of midiIn is FREE. However, next version will be
shareware. It will have lots of new features. Our todo list (I can't
promise all of this will exist in next version - everything depends on the
user feedback):

 - AHI support
 - for soundcards users: 4 channels audio output!!! (2 AHI channels
   thru soundcard, plus two Amiga hardware 14-bit channels)
 - new Mixer window with faders and panorama pots for each bank
 - Amplitude and Frequency Modulation (or tremolo and vibrato)
   controlled by Modulation Controller and LFO's syncronised to MIDI
   Clock
 - new audio level display (LED-like)
 - real-time effects like delay, chorus controlled by MIDI
 - tap tempo for easy synchronisation of drum loop samples with
   playing musicians
 - harddisk samples maybe...
 - improved Monitor window - it contains bugs now (all controllers are
   treated as 14-bit wide)
 - more controllers in Monitor window
 - reverse sample and reverse loop
 - Preview Mode for quick scan thru the Instrument List (clilck&hear)
 - intelligent AddProject function
 - faster response to MIDI messages
 - portamento (glide) in Mono mode
 - whatever You want ;)


Please don't send us complains about sound quality. The next
versions of midiIn will use AHI for mixing and playback, so we will
not work on audio routines, rather concentrate on using AHI.
