   This version of midiIn doesn't support AHI.
   midiIn uses standard Amiga audio hardware with 14 bit sample
resolution. We tried to make the audio routines as good as possible.
Mixing is made with 24 bit resolutions, overloads do not cause
random values of signal (too high values are set to maximum values)
- it means that in case of too many samples played too loud You
won't hear ticks and crackles, but a usual distortion.

   The mixing frequency is set in the <midiIn advanced window>.
   You can choose between 14 kHz, 20 kHz, 28 kHz, 41 kHz and 48 kHz.
Note that due to Amiga hardware limitations frequencies above 28 kHz
are available only when using higher video modes (Double or VGA
modes).
   Mixing frequency has influence on frequency range of played
sound. Maximum played frequency cannot be higher than half of the
sampling frequency. For example when You choose 28 kHz, maximum
frequency Amiga can play is 14 kHz. For professional use (as far as
Amiga audio hardware can be called professional...) You should use
48 kHz to get full audible frequency range (more than up to 20 kHz).
   The higher frequency, the more processor power is used, what
means that on the same computer You can get more/less virtual
channels depending on the mixing frequency.

   VIRTUAL CHANNELS
   midiIn uses its own procedures to mix sound. The number of samples
mixed depends on the speed of the processor. On A1200 with MTec 1230
running at 42 MHz, 12 samples can be mixed with no problems. On A1200
with Blizzard 1260 @ 50 MHz 32 channels can be mixed and there is
still lots of power for other tasks... We have not checked other
machines (please report!).
   To avoid problems You should set the number of virtual audio
channels (the number of samples played and mixed at one time)
in <midiIn advanced window> correctly. The best way is to set it to
maximum (32) first and play as many looped samples as possible.
When midiIn can't mix any more it cuts off the sound. You have to
count how many samples Your machine is able to mix and set the Chan
poly value correctly.
   Note that stereo samples take more processor power than mono
samples (although not twice as much). Be sure not to set the Chan
poly too high to avoid cutting off the sound during playback!

   If You try to play more samples than You have channels (Chan
poly), samples with lowest priority (see <How to work...>) are
muted.
