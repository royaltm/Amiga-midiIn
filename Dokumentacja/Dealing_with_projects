                       Dealing with projects
                       #####################

   To begin a new project just double click on midiIn icon ;)
   After loading the program is ready to work. You may be surprised
that Instrument List may contain some samples - don't worry,
everything is OK, You must have saved settings with these samples in
the List. They are now default. You can always clear the list and
save settings again.
   To clear the current project and start the new one choose the New
entry from Project menu. It will free all samples from memory and
reset all banks' settings. If the current project is unsaved (it
should have an asterisk (*) by it's name on midiIn window's drag
bar) midiIn will ask if You really want to loose it.
   
   Projects are saved by default in the PROGDIR:projects/ directory
(PROGDIR: in AmigaOS means the directory from which You start the
program - in this case midiIn). You can change this by saving a
project in a different place and saving settings. The new path will
be saved then.

   Projects do not contain the sound data (samples). They just
contain the sample path and filename, so they are quite short files.

   To load a project from disk select Open. A standard file
requester will appear.
   When You choose the project file, midiIn will load it and then
try to load all samples assigned to banks. The name and type of
currently loaded sample is shown in a small window. If the
sample cannot be found, a requester appears asking if You want
to replace this sample with another one (choose which one...), abort
loading, or skip to the next sample.
   You can also load a project by dragging it's icon to midiIn
Main Window.

* NOTE:  When changing the sample path in file requester window, the next
sample will be loaded from the directory you have chosen. So the best
thing is to keep all samples assigned to one project in the same
directory.  It is only important for people who often move files from
one directory to another.

  You can add an existing project to the current one. For example You may
have a nice drumset spread over the keyboard and saved as "drums" project.
Now while working on a project You want to use this drums. You have to
choose as current bank an empty one and select AddProject from Project
menu. After selecting the desired project midiIn will load it to banks
starting from the current one. In case of overlapping the new banks with
old ones, midiIn will ask if You want to overlap banks, skip used banks -
fill only empty ones, or abort loading.

[
* NOTE: This version of midiIn doesn't check if the added project's banks
don't overlap (ranges and MIDI channels) with existing ones, so be careful.
It may also override (clear) existing banks. We're working on it.
]

   To save a project to disk choose Save from the Project menu. If
Your project is new ("untitled"), a filerequester will appear asking
You for project's path and filename.

   Every project saved to disk contains all settings of midiIn:
sample playback parameters, MIDI configuration, audio filter, and
depending on the <Save layout> flag in the <Settings> menu, size and
position of midiIn windows.
   If the <Load with project> flag in the Settings menu is set, this
settings are loaded with project.  Sometimes it is good to have
different settings for different projects (for example audio
filter), sometimes only the default settings are used.  You always
have to remember about this flag to avoid problems.
